- Randomly choose a name out of list of
        Varun
        Pooja
        Krithika
        Keerthivasan
        Nikhilesh
- Randomly choose action out of:
        went to hotel
        went to beach
        went for movie
        went to park
        went to home
- Randomly choose a location out of list of:
        Buhari

        at 6:00 P.M.

How to do:
  - Create one fuction to eprform all of these
  - Use Math.floor(Math.random * [whatever the total number of options is]) to create a random number
  - EITHER create array to store possible answers and .push() them based on the random number
  - return concatenation of all strings
